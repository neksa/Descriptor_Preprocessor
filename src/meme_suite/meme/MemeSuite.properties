# Limits on website submissions per unique user.
# If a value is specified then it must match the pattern COUNT/TIME
# where both COUNT and TIME are integers.
# COUNT is the maximum number of uncompleted job submissions.
# TIME is the maximum tracking time in seconds for a job submission.
# If either COUNT or TIME is zero then there is no limit.
# For example, 4 unfinished jobs per hour is written as:
# quota = 4/3600
